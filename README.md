# Clip Viewer, WIP
Allows you to view twitch clips

You can create groups of streamers to view their clips at the same time instead of needing to go to each individual streamer's page

You can filter clips by a certain date range

Use left/right arrow keys to go to previous/next clip

You can view the app on https://clipviewer.onrender.com
